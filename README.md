# PDE_trial_lab
 try some intial PDE solvers as well as combining ML with PDE
 Just create traditional PDE solvers for elliptic (Poisson) and hyperbolic (Advection) equations, using Finite Difference Method (FDM) or Finite Element Method (FEM).
 We will try to combine ML with NPDE in the future, TBA.
