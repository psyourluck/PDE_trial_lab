generic_basis.py	generates the basis of freedom and the corresponding function in the 
		reference finite element
mesh_generate.py	generate the FEs: type (1) triangles and rectangles
poissson_solv_	solves the original problem the 2D poisson with mixed boudary condition with 2 different
		functions and two FEs: triangles and rectangles. It can also generate the scatter plot or 3D plot
		for the solution for the numerical methods.
plot.py		draw the loglog plot and estimate the order of accuracy
